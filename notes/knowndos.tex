\title{Summary of analytically known tight-binding density of states test cases}
\author{Alex Barnett}
\date{\today}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  We collect known density of states formulae for use as validation
  of numerical Brillouin zone integration methods, and in understanding
  the types of complex-plane singularities that occur.
\end{abstract}

Consider a crystalline quantum system with band Hamiltonian $H(\kk)$,
with wavevector $\kk\in \BZ := [0,2\pi)^d$, where the dimension $d=1$, $2$, or $3$.
We are handed a band Hamiltonian function in the form of a finite Fourier
series labelled by an integer frequency $\mm := (m_1,\dots,m_d)$,
\be
H(k) = \sum_{\mm\in{\cal M}} H_m e^{i\mm\cdot \kk}
\label{Hk}
\ee
where ${\cal M} := \{(m_1,\dots,m_d): |m_i|\le M\}$ is the array of 
$(2M+1)^d$ frequency indices centered about the origin.
$H$, and each $H_\mm$, is an $n\times n$ matrix.
$H(\kk)$ is self-adjoint for all $\kk\in\R^d$,
equivalent to the symmetry $H_\mm^* = H_{-\mm}$ for all $\mm\in\Z^d$, where
$^*$ indicates the complex transpose (Hermitian conjugate).

We stick to the paradigm self-energy term $\Sigma = iI\eta$
with broadening parameter $\eta\in\R$.
In this case, $\eta$ can be viewed as the imaginary part of
a complex energy $\om = \om_0 + i\eta$ in the closed upper half plane.
Given the matrix-valued function $H(\kk)$
described by Fourier coefficients $\{H_\mm\}$ up to frequency magnitude $M$,
energy $\om_0$, and $\eta\ge0$,
the quantity (``Green's function'') to compute is
\be
G(\om) \;:=\;
\int_\BZ \tr\, [\om I - H(\kk)]^{-1} d\kk.
\label{G}
\ee
This is a scalar function, analytic in the open upper half plane,
which follows since eigenvalues of $H(\kk)$ can only be real, and by
using that the integral of analytic functions is analytic (via Morera's theorem).
% *** lemma proving this would be good
For $\eta=0$ the limit $\eta=0^+$ is assumed.

We are interested in closed forms for $G(\om)$, to
test numerical methods and to understand
its singularities for $\om$ in the closed upper half plane.
The density of states (DOS) is then
\be
A(\om_0,\eta) := -\frac{1}{\pi}\im G(\om_0+i\eta),
\label{DOS}
\ee
which is thus harmonic, but no longer analytic, with respect to $\om=\om_0+i\eta$ in the upper half plane.
$A$ is usually sought as a function of energy $\om_0$,
fixing some broadening $\eta\ge0$.


\section{Scalar linear chain, square, and simple cubic lattices}

Here $n=1$ (a scalar case). We take fixed
nearest-neighbor tight binding interactions (of strength $1/2$), which become
the coefficients at frequencies $\pm 1$ in each dimension.
Thus $M=1$ is sufficient.
Some literature has
a factor of 2 or $2t$ in the definition (for interaction strength $1$ or $t$) relative to the below.
These results are adapted from \cite[Ch.~5]{economou}
and various papers of the 1970s.

\subsection{$d=1$ linear chain}
\label{s:1d}

We use $x$ for $\kk$ since it is scalar.
The nonzero coefficients are $H_{\pm 1} = 1/2$,
thus $H(x) = \cos x$,
so \eqref{G} becomes
\bea
G(\om) &=& \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{dx}{\om - \cos x}
= 2i \int_{|z|=1} \frac{dz}{z^2-2\om z + 1}
= 2i \int_{|z|=1} \frac{dz}{(z-z_+)(z-z_-)},
\nonumber
\eea
where we changed variable $z = e^{ix}$ so $dz/z = i\,dx$.
The denominator roots are $z_\pm = \om\pm i\sqrt{1-\om^2}$, where
the sign of the discriminant has been flipped in order to allow
the usual branch cut and square-root definition to apply.
Thus for $\im \om > 0$ the sign of $\im z_\pm$
matches the subscript of $z_\pm$.
Figure~\ref{f:zpaths} shows the resulting paths of $z_\pm$ as $\re \om$
varies at constant $\im \om$.
For $\im \om \ge 0$ then only $z_-$ is inside the unit circle, so
the residue is $2i/(z_--z_+) = -1/\sqrt{1-\om^2}$, so, by
the residue theorem,
\[
G(\om) \;=\; \frac{2\pi}{i \sqrt{1-\om^2}}.
\]
Considering $\om$ real ($\eta=0^+$),
$G$ is pure negative real for $\om<-1$ (below the band),
pure negative imaginary for $\om \in (-1,1)$ (in the band),
then pure positive real for $\om>1$ (above the band).
See \cite[Fig.~5.6]{economou}.
From \eqref{DOS} the DOS is $A(\om) = 2/\sqrt{1-\om^2}$ in the band and zero
outside the band.
For $\im \om$ small and positive (broadening),
the phase of $G(\om)$ rotates rapidly from negative real to negative imaginary as
$\re\om$ increases through $-1$, then continues to rotate to positive real
around $1$.
Here the peak magnitudes are roughly $\sqrt{2/\eta}$.
For $|\om|\gg 1$, $G \sim 2\pi/\om$ decays as if from
a single pole (which the two inverse-sqrt singularities combine to
behave like at large distances).
